# webserver-remote

This extension lets you expose the USB webserver to all interfaces (f.ex. Wi-Fi). It also shows a small popup on the tablet's screen whenever someone tries to connect to it - you are given the choice to accept the connection, ignore it, or ignore and block all connections from that IP address for the next 5 minutes (by long-pressing "Ignore").

This extension depends on [qt-resource-rebuilder](../qt-resource-rebuilder)
